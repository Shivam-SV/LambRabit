# Project templates

**New project** creates a folder in `www/` by running a *template*: a YAML file listing what to download, which commands to run and which files to write. lampRabit ships templates for Blank PHP, Laravel, Symfony, WordPress, CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Drupal, Statamic and a static site. You can add your own.

## Your own templates

Put `.yaml` (or `.yml`) files in the **`templates`** folder inside your environment folder (`C:\lampRabit\templates` or `~/lampRabit/templates`). **New project → Your templates** opens it, and creates it the first time with a commented example, `example.yaml.txt`. Rename that file to `.yaml` to try it.

- Templates are read every time **New project** opens, so changes show up straight away.
- A template whose `id` matches a built-in one replaces it.
- A file that can't be read is listed in the wizard with the reason (a typo, an unknown placeholder, a missing field), and the other templates still work.
- Uninstalling lampRabit keeps the `templates` folder, like `www` and `data`.

### Safety

Templates run commands on your computer. Built-in templates run without asking. For your own templates, lampRabit lists every step that looks risky before running anything, and you must tick a box to approve them. Risky steps include:

- deleting files recursively (`rm -rf`, `rmdir /s`, `Remove-Item`);
- running as administrator (`sudo`, `runas`);
- piping downloads into a shell (`curl … | sh`, `iex`);
- touching system or home folders, or reaching outside the project (`..`);
- editing the registry;
- downloading a file without a checksum, or over plain HTTP.

Everything else runs normally. File steps (`write`, `copy`, `env`…) can only touch paths inside the new project.

## Reference

### Top level

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | yes | Template format version. Must be `1`. |
| `id` | yes | Unique name: letters, numbers, `-` and `_`. Recorded with each project (`id@version`). |
| `name` | yes | Shown on the template card. |
| `description` | | One line under the name. |
| `version` | | The template's own version (default 1). Bump it when you change the steps. |
| `icon` | | `code`, `file`, `flame`, `flame-kindling`, `boxes`, `newspaper`, `cake`, `droplet`, `zap`, `layers`, `box`. |
| `color` | | `red`, `orange`, `amber`, `sky`, `blue`, `indigo`, `pink`, `rose`, `teal`, `zinc`. |
| `duration` | | A hint such as `Composer · about a minute`. |
| `requires.php` | | Lowest PHP version (`"8.2"`) or `any`. Leave it out for projects without PHP; the wizard then hides the PHP choice. |
| `requires.extensions` | | PHP extensions that must be loaded. Checked with `php -m` before anything is created; the error says to turn them on in Services → PHP → Extensions. |
| `database` | | `none` (default), `optional` (a switch, on when a database server is installed) or `required`. |
| `variables` | | Extra fields in the wizard (below). |
| `steps` | yes | What to do, in order (below). |
| `done` | | Shown when the project is ready; placeholders work. |

### Variables

```yaml
variables:
  - id: stack            # used as {{vars.stack}}
    label: Breeze stack
    type: choice         # text (default), choice or bool ("true"/"false")
    options: [blade, react, vue]
    default: blade
    help: Shown under the field.
    required: true       # Create stays disabled while it's empty
  - id: api_key
    label: API key
    if: vars.stack == react   # shown (and filled in) only while this holds; empty otherwise
```

Optional steps with an `if:` show their checkbox only while the condition holds, so a template can offer one step per choice (Magento's two-factor switch differs between Mage-OS and Adobe's edition).

### Steps

Each step has exactly one action, plus any of these common keys:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | The progress heading. Without one, lampRabit describes the action. |
| `if` | Runs only when this holds: `database`, `!database`, `vars.stack == react`, `vars.stack != blade`. Empty, `false` and `none` count as false. |
| `optional` | Shows a checkbox in the wizard. Use `label` for its text and `default: false` to start unticked (default `true`). |
| `id` | Names the step (needed for optional steps). Defaults to its position. |
| `needs` | Tools the step needs on PATH: `node` (npm, npx) or `git`. Checked before anything is created, but only when the step will run. |
| `cwd` | Working folder: `www`, or a folder inside the project. Defaults to the project folder. `composer create-project` runs in `www`. |

The actions:

| Action | Example | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `composer` | `composer: [require, laravel/breeze, --dev]` | Runs Composer with the project's PHP and lampRabit's php.ini. Composer is installed the first time it's needed. |
| `php` | `php: [artisan, migrate, --force]` | Runs the project's PHP. |
| `run` | `run: npm install && npm run build` | A shell command: `cmd /C` on Windows, `sh -c` elsewhere. The project's PHP and lampRabit's commands (`php`, `composer`, `mysql`, `redis-cli`) come first on PATH. |
| `download` | see below | Downloads a file, checks its checksum, and unpacks or saves it. |
| `write` | `write: { path: index.php, content: "…" }` | Creates a file (and its folders). |
| `append` | `append: { path: settings.php, content: "…" }` | Adds to the end of a file. |
| `copy` | `copy: { from: .env.example, to: .env }` | Copies a file inside the project. |
| `env` | see below | Sets keys in a `.env`-style file, adding missing ones. |
| `replace` | see below | Replaces text in a file. |
| `create_database` | `create_database: {}` | Creates the database named in the wizard, starting the database server if needed. Skipped when no database was chosen. Put it first: a name that's taken then stops everything before any long download. |
| `git_init` | `git_init: { commit: First commit }` | `git init`, plus a first commit when Git knows your name and email. Skipped, with a note, when Git isn't installed. |

`download`:

```yaml
- download:
    url: https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
    sha1_url: https://wordpress.org/latest.zip.sha1   # or sha256_url, or sha256: <hex>
    extract: true          # .zip, .tar.gz or .tgz, unpacked into the project
    strip: wordpress       # take the contents of this folder in the archive
    # to: vendor/tool.phar # without extract: where to save it (default: the file name)
```

`env` finds keys even when the file ships them commented out (`# DB_HOST=…`), and keeps a file's `KEY = value` spacing (CodeIgniter):

```yaml
- env:
    file: .env.local       # default .env
    values:
      APP_URL: "{{url}}"
      MAIL_PORT: "{{mail.port}}"
```

`replace` renders the new text separately for each occurrence, so `{{random:64}}` gives every match its own secret (WordPress's keys and salts). If the text isn't found, the step notes it in the output and carries on, because upstream files change between releases.

```yaml
- replace:
    file: wp-config.php
    values:
      database_name_here: "{{database}}"
      put your unique phrase here: "{{random:64}}"
```

### Placeholders

Write `{{name}}` anywhere a step takes text. Unknown names are reported when the template loads, not halfway through a project.

| Placeholder | Value |
|---|---|
| `{{project}}` | The folder name |
| `{{domain}}`, `{{url}}` | `shop.test`, `https://shop.test` (no trailing slash) |
| `{{www}}`, `{{dir}}` | The www folder, the project folder |
| `{{php_version}}` | The PHP version the project uses |
| `{{database}}` | The database name from the wizard (empty when none) |
| `{{db.engine}}` | `mariadb` or `mysql` (the default database server) |
| `{{db.host}}`, `{{db.port}}` | `127.0.0.1` and the server's port |
| `{{db.user}}`, `{{db.password}}` | `root` and an empty password |
| `{{db.server_version}}` | `11.8.9-MariaDB` or `8.4.13` (Doctrine's `serverVersion`) |
| `{{mail.host}}`, `{{mail.port}}` | Mailpit's SMTP server |
| `{{vars.<id>}}` | A variable's value |
| `{{random:N}}` | N random characters (1–256), safe inside quoted PHP and `.env` strings |

YAML reads a value that starts with `{` as a map, so quote values that begin with a placeholder: `"{{project}}"`.

## What happens when you click Create

1. The project name, database name and template are checked, and the site's PHP version, web server and HTTPS are saved.
2. If the template creates a database, the database server is started.
3. Requirements: PHP version, extensions, and the tools of the steps that will run. Nothing has been created yet, so a missing requirement leaves nothing behind.
4. The steps run in order, with their output shown live.
5. The web server restarts with the new site.

If a step fails, the project folder is removed and its settings are forgotten. A database created earlier in the run stays; delete it in phpMyAdmin or Adminer if you don't need it, or pick another database name when you try again.
