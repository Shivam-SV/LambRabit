# lampRabit website content pack

Everything needed to build the lampRabit marketing and documentation website. The copy in these files is final-draft quality and can be used as-is or edited for tone.

## What lampRabit is

lampRabit is a free, open-source desktop app that runs a complete local PHP development environment: Apache or Nginx, PHP (several versions side by side), MariaDB, and developer tools like phpMyAdmin, Adminer and Mailpit. Every folder you put in `www/` becomes a site at `https://<folder>.test`, with a trusted local certificate. It is a modern alternative to XAMPP and Laragon, built with Rust and Tauri.

**One-line pitch:** Your local PHP stack, without the setup.

**Short description (about 160 characters, for meta tags):** lampRabit runs Apache or Nginx, PHP and MariaDB on your machine. Drop a folder in www, get https://yourapp.test. Free and open source.

## Files in this pack

| File | Use it for |
|---|---|
| [features.md](features.md) | Features page, homepage highlights, comparison table |
| [installation.md](installation.md) | Download / Install page and "Getting started" docs |

## Feature status

lampRabit is under active development. Every feature in these files is marked:

- **Available**: in the app today.
- **Coming soon**: designed and scheduled; it will ship before or shortly after the first public release.

Show both on the website (for example a small "Coming soon" badge). Don't hide coming-soon features, but don't present them as available either. The app team will tell you when a feature moves to Available, so the badge can be removed.

Some features are limited by platform. Where that's the case, the feature text says so. The app runs on Windows, macOS and Linux, but **one-click runtime downloads currently cover Windows fully; macOS and Linux downloads are partial** (see the platform table in [installation.md](installation.md)).

## Suggested site map

## Brand

### Name

Always written **lampRabit**: lowercase "lamp", capital "R", single "b". In the logo lockup, "Rabit" is set in the accent colour.

### Logo

- Mark only (no wordmark): `public/logo.svg` in the repository.
- Original with wordmark: `public/LampRabit-logo.svg`.
- App icon (white rounded tile): `src-tauri/app-icon.svg`; PNG sizes in `src-tauri/icons/`.

The mark is a charcoal rabbit head with mint ears and `< >` code brackets for eyes. On dark backgrounds the app lightens the head to `#3a4452` so it stays visible.

### Colours

| Token | Light theme | Dark theme | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Background | `#f4f7f6` | `#13171d` | Page background |
| Surface | `#ffffff` | `#1b2028` | Cards |
| Surface 2 | `#eef2f1` | `#232a34` | Subtle fills |
| Border | `#dde3e1` | `#2d3540` | Card borders, dividers |
| Text | `#1b2028` | `#e7ecf1` | Body text |
| Muted text | `#5d6775` | `#8d98a7` | Secondary text |
| Accent | `#168a64` | `#59d1a2` | Buttons, links, highlights |
| Accent soft | `#e2f5ed` | mint at 12% opacity | Pills, selected states |
| Danger | `#d1435b` | `#ef6b7f` | Errors |

Brand core: charcoal `#1b2028`, mint `#59d1a2`, white. In light mode the accent is the deeper green `#168a64` because mint on white fails contrast for text.

Service colours used across the app (icons and badges): Apache rose `#f43f5e`, Nginx emerald `#059669`, PHP indigo `#6366f1`, MariaDB amber `#d97706`, Mailpit sky `#0ea5e9`, Adminer teal `#14b8a6`, phpMyAdmin orange `#f97316`.

### Type

Inter (variable), with system UI fonts as fallback. Headings bold to extra-bold with slightly tight tracking; code and ports in a monospace (JetBrains Mono / Cascadia Code / Consolas).

### Voice

Plain, friendly, specific. Say what happens ("Drop a folder in www and it's live at myapp.test") rather than abstract claims ("seamless developer experience"). Avoid jargon where a plain word works; when a technical term matters to developers (FastCGI, vhost), use it.

## Screenshots to capture

Take these from the app in both light and dark themes at 1280×860:

1. Overview with Apache, MariaDB and Mailpit running (hero image).
2. Services page: "Your stack" diagram with services running, plus a version rail.
3. Sites page with two or three sites, one on a custom PHP version.
4. Logs page with a mix of Apache, PHP and System lines.
5. Settings: Web server card set to "Both".
6. A service card showing a port-conflict problem panel (start a service while another program holds its port).
7. Diagnostics dialog.

Use project names like `shop`, `blog`, `api` rather than personal folders, and keep the Windows user name out of shots (Diagnostics has a "Hide user name" switch).
